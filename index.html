        <p>Let's make some pretty together, shall we?</p>
        <p> That's, at least, what I always try to do!
        I have always been an artist, but I fell back
        in love with painting after having had the chance
        to create some pieces for my own wedding.
        As an arts manager and web developer, I'm always
        surrounded by creative and inspiring people.
        But, nothing beats working a canvas with your
        own hands and imagination.</p>
        <p>My style is light, flowy, even a bit ethereal.
        My two favorite tools? White paint and my fingers.
        Yep, I prefer to paint with my fingers over my brushes!
        The outcome: a totally custom, totally unique,
        totally pretty piece (or pieces) you and your significant
        other can keep and display for a lifetime.</p>
        <p>When not creating paintings and crests, you can find me
        in the kitchen cooking up my signature steak au poivre,
        taking in the glory that is my favorite vanilla candle,
        working the world wide web, and enjoying weekend trips
        with my pilot hubby Tim.</p>
