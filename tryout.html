          <p>Let's make some pretty together, shall we?</p>
          <p> That's, at least, what I always try to do!
          I have always been an artist, but I fell back
          in love with painting after having had the chance
          to create some pieces for my own wedding.
          As an arts manager and web developer, I'm always
          surrounded by creative and inspiring people.
          But, nothing beats working a canvas with your
          own hands and imagination.</p>
          <p>My style is light, flowy, even a bit ethereal.
          My two favorite tools? White paint and my fingers.
          Yep, I prefer to paint with my fingers over my brushes!
          The outcome: a totally custom, totally unique,
          totally pretty piece (or pieces) you and your significant
          other can keep and display for a lifetime.</p>
          <p>When not creating paintings and crests, you can find me
          in the kitchen cooking up my signature steak au poivre,
          taking in the glory that is my favorite vanilla candle,
          working the world wide web, and enjoying weekend trips
          with my pilot hubby Tim.</p>
